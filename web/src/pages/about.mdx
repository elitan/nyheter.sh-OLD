## Are you our next Editor-in-Chief (ChefredaktÃ¶r)?

Do you want to become Nyheter.sh's editor in chief? Are you a young journalist or journalist student who want to make a difference?

The website is currently fully automated and uses AI to generate text, images and audio.

This is not sustainable in the long run.

We probably need some human oversight to do the final 10% of the editing and editorial decisions.

Does it sounds interesting?
